# CourseGrader---cpp
Student Assignment and Grade Management.
## CourseGrader is a powerful WPF-based desktop application designed to streamline the management of student assignments and grades. This application enables educators to efficiently import, view, edit, and save student grades for various courses. The application reads data from Excel files and saves all course-related information in JSON format for persistent storage, ensuring that the original Excel files remain unaltered.

  - Grades can be edited directly within the application, with changes immediately reflected in the student's final grade.
  - A "Save" button allows for manual saving of updated grades to the course's JSON file.

- **Persistent Storage**: 
  - All course data is saved as JSON files named after the original Excel file, with a timestamp indicating the last update.
  - On startup, previously saved courses are loaded, allowing users to continue managing courses from where they left off.
